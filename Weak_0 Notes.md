Mindset of a good Programmer:
  1. Always give value first:
    - minimize excessive questions instead.....
    - give something that is useful to them: How is this person winning form me ( you want them to win more than you)
  2. Never say you CANT do something. Instead say 'How can I'
    - Go up and beyond to help the next person, Make it a habit.
  3. Take FULL responsibility for your FALIURE & SUCCESS.
    - Your Failure and your success is your responsibility - Put everything on you so you will make an effort to make a change. Don't blame others nor shortchange yourself.
  4. Be Brutally honest with yourself
    - PDA : Public display of Accountability
    - Be conscious on your goals - the accountability will give you the benefit to be conscious
    - 'What get measured, gets managed'
    4.1. Never say 'I already know this/that!
      - Will close your mind to the learning process.
    4.2. Look for critique.
      - Take in critique and improve on it.

Secret to never quit again!
How?
  Motivation: this is something you can reverse engineer .
    - what happens when motivation runs out ? - we usually quit :(.
    - so.... How do we recreate this motivation?
  Manage how our thoughts get shaped by what we are exposed to. Motivation is rooted from thoughts we have and thoughts are a mere combination of others opinions.
    - our thoughts are not our thought ?
      - this is from your friends, media, family, etc.
    ***Motivation is just an initial push **** It will run out.
    To keep this motivation constant, we require a system _ this is the *secret*

    when u feel like you gonna quit...
    Relax, take a breadth, and go at your pace. Dont quitttt.

Different ways to succeed:
- think about your money and time - earn more and work less
1. What can you with money:
    Affect your life and the people around you. -- Money is not bad it is just how you use it.
2. Top 10 things you can use money for (me, myself and I):
    1. Never let people dependent on me to have a worry of 'not enough money' - Depleting the worry of not being to survive on a daily basis. Eliminating worry will be goal to strive for.
    2. Save for myself - Save for a rainy day. Life is never smooth. look ahead and plan for hiccups around the corner.
    3. spend on myself - Grow and always be hungry. Be it Coding or soft skills or knowledge. Dont have the 2nd thought of will this be worth it. Take a step forward weighing the pros and cons but dont let money be a Con again.
    4. Find a mentor - in both life and work. Everyone always need guidance. This is more so for me. More than not, I will find myself lost and unsure on how to move on . In such a time a mentor would have guided and saved so much time . How to find a mentor ? this im not sure off.
    5. Donate ( Adobt a child in Africa ) - this is also selfish. Money will change you. Always be ready to give. Money will not last. Spend on yourself, YES, but also spend on the world. Not everyone will be as lucky as you in this world. Be humble.
    6. Start a business but be one that I will not have to always oversee. Get decent leaders and managers. Create a system, where it can run without me.
    7. Invest - learn to invest. Study and get educated in the art. Get into a good course, learn practically after accruing interest, learn theoretically.
    8. Set a side of money and invest. Dont have a connection to the money lost. Not all investment will be right but have the money to experiment and learn.
    9. Get a trainer and get a body I always wanted. I have started and given up so many times. Get a trainer a membership in the gym and have the guidance that will help me to achieve that.
    10. Spend on family. Give my dad what he wants, spend time w my family.
